I've audited over 70 Shopify stores. The first thing most owners tell me: "My PageSpeed score is fine." Then I show them their actual load time, and their face drops.

Here's the thing - PageSpeed Insights measures a lot. But not everything that matters for conversions. (Spoiler: what matters is whether people can actually buy stuff.)

## The Metric Everyone Ignores

Time to Interactive (TTI) is what kills conversions. Your store might "load" in 2 seconds, but if users can't click the add-to-cart button for another 3 seconds? You've lost them.

I see this constantly with stores that:
- Have too many apps installed
- Use heavy sliders on the homepage
- Load all product images at once

## What I Actually Measure

When I audit a store, I look at:

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: When does the main content appear?
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: How long before users can interact?
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: How much time is JavaScript hogging?

These tell me more than any aggregate score. Way more.

## The Quick Wins

Before you hire anyone (including me), try these:

1. **Remove unused apps** - Every app adds JavaScript. Uninstall what you're not using. Seriously.
2. **Lazy load images below the fold** - Don't load what users can't see yet. Simple.
3. **Audit your theme's JavaScript** - Some themes ship megabytes of unused code. It's wild.

## When to Get Help

If you've done the basics and still see:
- LCP over 2.5 seconds
- TBT over 300ms  
- Bounce rates above 50%

Then it might be worth a professional audit. But try the free stuff first - sometimes that's enough.

## The Real Point

Look - speed isn't about hitting a magic number. It's about whether real users can browse and buy without frustration. Measure what matters, not what looks good on a screenshot.
