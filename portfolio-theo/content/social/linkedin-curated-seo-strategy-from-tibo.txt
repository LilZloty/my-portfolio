Is your SEO strategy truly optimized for long-term growth, or are you just chasing quick wins?

I came across Tibo's latest thread on X, where he breaks down his proven SEO approach as a maker. 
What stood out was his emphasis on building authority through consistent, value-driven content rather than keyword stuffing. 
It reminded me how sustainable SEO can transform organic traffic into a reliable revenue stream.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- Focus on topical authority by creating clusters of related content that answer user intent deeply, not just superficially.
- Leverage internal linking strategically to guide users and search engines through your site's ecosystem.
- Track performance with tools like Google Analytics to iterate based on real data, ensuring your efforts compound over time.

As someone who's helped multiple Shopify stores scale through e-commerce SEO, I see a direct connection here. 
Tibo's method aligns perfectly with optimizing product pages and blogs to drive conversions - think using these tactics to turn casual visitors into loyal customers by addressing pain points in your niche. 
It's not about gaming the algorithm; it's about creating genuine value that Google rewards.

What's one SEO tweak you've made recently that boosted your site's traffic?
