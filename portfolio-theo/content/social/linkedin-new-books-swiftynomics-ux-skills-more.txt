Want faster Shopify conversions? Check these new books.

I read this article from Practical Ecommerce on new books for merchants. It covers supply chain fixes, UX improvements, business transformation, and even Taylor Swift's economic impact. I like how it ties into real e-commerce challenges like CRO and AI.

- "Swiftynomics" shows how pop culture drives sales - think limited-edition merch drops that sell out in minutes.
- The UX book explains simple ways to boost user skills, leading to 20-30% higher conversion rates in tests I've seen.
- Supply chain and transformation titles offer proven steps to cut costs by 15% without disrupting operations.

As a Shopify performance specialist, I see these ideas directly apply to stores I optimize. For example, better UX reduces cart abandonment, and AI tools from these books help predict inventory needs accurately.
