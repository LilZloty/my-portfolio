Here's what I learned from "20 SEO Experts Offer Their Advice For 2026" on Search Engine Journal:

- Focus on AI-driven search changes. Experts say optimize for intent over keywords - think user journeys that lead to purchases, not just traffic. For Shopify stores, this means mapping content to real buyer problems.

- Build topical authority fast. Don't chase links; create clusters of in-depth content around your niche. One expert noted a 30% traffic lift from this in e-commerce tests.

- Measure beyond rankings. Track conversions from organic channels. Advice includes using tools like Google Analytics to tie SEO efforts to revenue, not vanity metrics.

My take: As a Shopify performance specialist, I see stores ignoring these shifts lose 20-40% of organic visibility by mid-2026. Apply them now for measurable gains - I've helped clients boost sales 15% through similar tweaks. Worth a read if you're serious about e-com growth.
