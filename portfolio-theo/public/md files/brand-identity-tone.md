Brand Identity Tone Guide
Theo Daudebourg - AI-Powered Shopify Performance Specialist
Core Identity
Who You Are
A technical craftsman with systems-level thinking who bridges the gap between complex AI/automation and real e-commerce results. You're not a generalist agency or a one-trick freelancer - you're a specialist who goes deep.

Your Superpower
You combine deep technical expertise (7+ years, 70+ stores, systems architecture) with AI-powered automation to deliver measurable, data-driven results for Shopify stores.

Industry Versatility
You're a fast learner who adapts to any niche. You've worked with:
- Auto parts (current - Mexico market)
- Cosmetics and beauty brands
- Cereal and food brands
- Hospital equipment

This isn't a weakness - it's a superpower. You understand that conversion principles are universal. The packaging changes, the psychology doesn't.

Global Reach - Three Markets, Three Languages
- US Market (English) - Direct, results-focused communication
- European Market (French) - Premium positioning, sophistication
- LATAM Market (Spanish) - Relationship-first, trust-building

This makes you uniquely versatile. You can help brands expand internationally because you actually understand the cultural nuances.

Target Client Profile
- Revenue: Zero to $1M+ (you've helped stores at every stage)
- Team: Works with solo founders or in-house teams
- Mindset: Values transparency over flash, systems over quick fixes
- Pain: Tired of agencies that overpromise, or cheap devs that underdeliver

Tiered Offer Strategy
Your pricing funnel is intentional:
- Starter ($197-$497): Low-risk entry point. Let clients test you. Approachable, "let's get you going" vibe.
- Growth ($1k-$5k): Proven value. Confident, professional tone.
- Scale ($3k-$8k+): Premium, consultative. Results speak for themselves.

The goal: convert starters into recurring retainer clients.

Competitive Positioning
What makes you different from:

Agencies ($10k+ retainers):
- You're the specialist, not a junior account manager
- No bloated teams, no communication layers
- Same quality, fraction of the overhead

Fiverr devs ($50 theme tweaks):
- You understand business, not just code
- Systems thinking vs. band-aid fixes
- Accountability and ongoing support

AI-generated SEO tools:
- AI is your tool, not your replacement
- Human strategy + AI execution = actual results
- Custom pipelines, not cookie-cutter outputs


Voice Pillars
1. Honest and No-BS
"I'll tell you upfront if CRO makes sense for your store."

Skip the jargon and marketing fluff
Be upfront about what's realistic vs. what's hype
Admit limitations - builds trust
Use concrete numbers, not vague claims
Do: "Every second of delay costs you 7% of conversions." Don't: "Our revolutionary solutions supercharge your digital presence."

2. Technical but Accessible
"I build systems that work, not black boxes."

Show you understand the why behind the code
Explain complex concepts simply - you're a guide, not a gatekeeper
Use specifics (PageSpeed, LCP, FCP) but translate impact
Do: "AI pipeline setup (Claude/GPT) for bulk product meta optimization." Don't: "We leverage cutting-edge machine learning paradigms."

3. Results-Obsessed
"Real numbers. Real stores."

Lead with outcomes, not features
Before/After metrics are your proof
Every claim has a receipt
Do: "45 to 92 PageSpeed. 2.1% to 3.8% conversion rate." Don't: "We help businesses grow online."

4. Quietly Confident
"7 years. 70+ stores. Honest about what works."

Let results speak - no need to shout
Calm authority > desperate sales pitch
Premium positioning through restraint
Do: "I help Shopify brands load faster, convert higher, and rank better." Don't: "I'm THE BEST Shopify developer you'll EVER find!!!"

Writing Rules
Character Guidelines
Use regular dashes (-) not special em-dashes
Use straight quotes (") not curly quotes
NO emojis or Unicode symbols
NO special characters that look AI-generated
Keep punctuation simple and standard
Headlines
Problem-first or outcome-first
10 words or less
Bold, direct, specific
Use ALL CAPS strategically for emphasis
Examples:

"YOUR SHOPIFY STORE IS BLEEDING MONEY"
"Hit 90+ PageSpeed. In 7 Days."
"Real Numbers. Real Stores."
Body Copy
Active voice, present tense
Short sentences. Short paragraphs.
"You" language - always about the customer
Specific > vague (always include numbers)
One idea per sentence
Use contractions (I'm, don't, it's, you're)
Example:

"Visitors leave before they even see your products. Every second of delay costs you 7% of conversions. There has to be a better way. (There is.)"

CTAs
Action verb first
Specific outcome, not generic action
First person when appropriate
Good:

"Get My Free Store Audit"
"Show Me How It Works"
"Let's Start With Step 1"
"Discuss Your Project"
Avoid:

"Submit"
"Learn More"
"Click Here"
"Contact Us"
